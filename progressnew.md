# FunnelHQ 360 - Clerk + Supabase Implementation Progress

## Project Discovery
- **Project Type**: Vite + React (NOT Next.js) with Express.js backend
- **Current Auth**: Mock authentication system in place
- **Architecture**: Client-server with TypeScript throughout
- **Key Finding**: Will need Clerk React SDK instead of Next.js SDK

## Phase 1 - Clerk Integration

### Step 1: Bootstrap Clerk SDK (Completed)
- ✅ Installed @clerk/clerk-react package
- ✅ Created .env.example with Clerk environment variables
- ✅ Added ClerkProvider to App.tsx wrapping the entire app
- ✅ Added TypeScript declarations for environment variables

**What was done**: Installed Clerk React SDK, configured environment variables structure, and wrapped the app with ClerkProvider.
**Why**: This establishes the foundation for Clerk authentication throughout the application.

### Step 2: Replace Auth Components with Clerk (Completed)
- ✅ Created dedicated login page with Clerk SignIn component
- ✅ Created dedicated signup page with Clerk SignUp component  
- ✅ Added routes for /login and /signup in App.tsx
- ✅ Created ClerkProtectedRoute component to handle authentication
- ✅ Replaced all ProtectedRoute instances with ClerkProtectedRoute
- ✅ Styled Clerk components to match dark theme

**What was done**: Created login/signup pages using Clerk components and updated all protected routes to use Clerk authentication.
**Why**: This replaces the mock authentication with real Clerk authentication while maintaining the existing permission system.

### Step 3: Custom Magic-link & OTP UI (Completed)
- ✅ Enhanced SignIn/SignUp components with magic link support
- ✅ Added OTP field styling and configuration
- ✅ Created shared Clerk appearance configuration
- ✅ Added support for alternative authentication methods
- ✅ Created CLERK_SETUP.md with detailed configuration instructions

**What was done**: Configured Clerk components to support magic links and OTP authentication with custom dark theme styling.
**Why**: This provides users with passwordless authentication options, improving security and user experience.

### Step 4: Enable Multi-Organization Logic (Completed)
- ✅ Created useOrganization hook for organization management
- ✅ Built OrganizationSwitcher component with create/switch functionality
- ✅ Auto-creates organization with Pro Trial plan on first sign-up
- ✅ Added organization switcher to sidebar UI
- ✅ Updated CLERK_SETUP.md with detailed organization configuration steps

**What was done**: Implemented multi-organization support with auto-creation, switching UI, and Pro Trial initialization.
**Why**: Enables users to manage multiple organizations with separate projects, team members, and billing plans.

### Step 5: Implement Organization Invitation Flow (Completed)
- ✅ Created OrganizationInvitations component for managing invites
- ✅ Built invitation acceptance page and flow
- ✅ Added invitation management UI to Team page
- ✅ Implemented invitation token handling in signup flow
- ✅ Created role-based invitation system (admin, team_member, client)
- ✅ Updated CLERK_SETUP.md with invitation configuration

**What was done**: Built complete invitation system allowing admins to invite team members with specific roles via email.
**Why**: Enables organizations to grow their teams securely with role-based access control from the start.

### Step 6: Configure Role Metadata in publicMetadata (Completed)
- ✅ Updated useAuth hook to read roles from Clerk organization membership
- ✅ Created UserRoleManager component for viewing/managing metadata
- ✅ Integrated metadata display in Settings page
- ✅ Created server endpoints for metadata updates
- ✅ Documented metadata structure in CLERK_SETUP.md
- ✅ Implemented role mapping: org roles → app permissions

**What was done**: Configured Clerk to store roles, plans, and features in metadata with proper role mapping from organizations.
**Why**: Enables persistent storage of user roles and organization data that syncs across sessions and devices.

### Step 7: Setup Clerk Webhooks (Completed)
- ✅ Installed svix for webhook signature verification
- ✅ Created webhook handler for all major Clerk events
- ✅ Added webhook routes with proper raw body handling
- ✅ Implemented handlers for user.created, organization.created, membership events
- ✅ Created test endpoints for webhook development
- ✅ Documented webhook setup in WEBHOOK_SETUP.md

**What was done**: Set up secure webhook endpoints to sync Clerk events with the application, including user creation and organization management.
**Why**: Enables real-time synchronization between Clerk and the application database, ensuring consistent state across systems.

### Step 8: Implement Client-Side Hooks for Route Gating (Completed)
- ✅ Created useRouteGuard hook for comprehensive route protection
- ✅ Built usePlanFeatures hook to check plan limits and features
- ✅ Implemented useTrialStatus hook for trial expiration handling
- ✅ Created RouteGuard component with loading and unauthorized states
- ✅ Added TrialBanner component for upgrade prompts
- ✅ Updated ClerkProtectedRoute to use new routing system
- ✅ Documented all hooks and components in CLERK_SETUP.md

**What was done**: Built a comprehensive client-side routing protection system with hooks for auth, roles, permissions, and plan features.
**Why**: Ensures secure, role-based access control throughout the application with proper loading states and user feedback.

### Step 9: Add Unit Tests for Role-Based Redirection (Completed)
- ✅ Set up Vitest with React Testing Library
- ✅ Created comprehensive mock utilities for Clerk
- ✅ Added tests for useRouteGuard hook
- ✅ Added tests for RouteGuard component
- ✅ Added tests for usePlanFeatures hook
- ✅ Created role-based redirection test suite
- ✅ Added test scripts to package.json
- ✅ Created testing documentation

**What was done**: Implemented comprehensive test suite for authentication, authorization, and role-based routing with 80%+ coverage targets.
**Why**: Ensures reliability and prevents regressions in critical auth flows, especially role-based access control and trial expiration.
