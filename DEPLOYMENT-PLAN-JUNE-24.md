| Admin | ✅ All conversations | ✅ All conversations | ✅ Correct |
| Team Member | ❌ Can message clients | ❌ Admin only | ❌ Fix needed |
| Client | ✅ Admin messaging | ✅ Admin messaging | ✅ Correct |

#### **3. Project Access Controls**
- Current: Some team members might see all projects
- Required: Team members only see assigned projects
- Status: Needs verification and possible fixes

---

## 📝 **Requirements Clarification**

### **Communication System Architecture**

#### **Project Comments/Threads**
```
Client creates comment on project
    ↓
Admin/Team Member (assigned to project) can reply
    ↓
Threaded conversation visible to all project participants
```

#### **Direct Messaging Panel**
```
Admin ←→ Client (bidirectional)
Admin ←→ Team Member (bidirectional) 
Team Member → Admin (unidirectional - team cannot message clients)
```

#### **Access Control Matrix**
| Role | Project Access | Client Messaging | Team Messaging | Project Comments |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Admin** | All projects | ✅ Send/Receive | ✅ Send/Receive | ✅ All projects |
| **Team Member** | Assigned only | ❌ No access | ✅ Send to admin only | ✅ Assigned projects |
| **Client** | Own projects only | ✅ Send/Receive to admin | ❌ No access | ✅ Own projects |

## 🎯 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Approach: Phased Deployment**
1. **Fix Critical Issues First**: Data persistence, then communication
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test each phase before proceeding
3. **Non-Breaking Changes**: Maintain current functionality while improving
4. **Rollback Capability**: Each phase can be reverted if needed

### **Development Principles**
- **Safety First**: Database backups before changes
- **Test-Driven**: Verify each change works before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Log all changes for future reference
- **User Experience**: Maintain seamless user experience throughout
